# Deep Learning based Cryptanalysis

## Overview

This is an implementation<sup>[1]</sup> of an attack on different lightweight ciphers using deep learning.

This had multiple attempts and tried multiple ideas and it is still under development.

The big overall idea is to try to train a machine learning algorithm to predict the key of a message-ciphertext pair.

I will check other ideas outside Machine Learning to see if they provide results.
