# Course Work

## Overview

This is a collection of relevant work I did for my courses.

## Description

Here are all the topics I covered:

* Search algorithms
    * A*
    * Hill Climb search algorithms
    * Monte Carlo Tree Search (UCB - Upper Confidence Bound)
* Bayesian network
    * Variable elimination
* Machine Learning algorithms
    * Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Tree
    * CNN - using PyTorch
    * NLP - Naive Bayes based Sentiment Classification

Also there are 2 additional folders:

* Rubik's cube - finding the solution to a toy version of the Rubik's cube (2x2x2), using various search algorithms and provide comparisons (A*, Bidirectional BFS, MCTS) and different heuristics

* Revenue Classification - a classification problem using various ML algorithms, manually implemented and their sciki-learn counterpart (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree), as well as different comparisons of their performances.
